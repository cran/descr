    - odfTable method for object of class CrossTable.

    - Improved xtable method for object of class CrossTable.


Version 0.3.4 (2011-04-24)
--------------------------

  Changes:

    - Objects of classes meanscomp, freqtable and CrossTable now have
      plot methods.


Version 0.3.3 (2011-02-08)
--------------------------

  Changes:

    - compmeans(): When sort=T the boxplots are sorted too.
                   Uses wtd.boxplot of package NEmisc.
                   Returns a matrix instead of a list.
    
    - freq(): Returns a matrix instead of a list.

    - Changed the dependency of xtable from Depends to Imports.

    - fwf2csv: Only prints message about number of lines saved 
      if the value of "verbose" option is TRUE.

    - Added argument user.missing to freq(), compmeans(), and crosstab().


Version 0.3.2 (2009-10-11)
--------------------------

  Bug fix:

    - Fixed documentation link to read.fwf().

    - Added domain = "R-descr" to all gettext().

    - Fixed conversion of fwf into csv when the fwf had \r\n line terminators
      and R was running on Linux. Also fixed reading of strings with spaces.

  Changes:

    - Inverted colors in the mosaic plot produced by crosstab().

    - Only add cumulative percent to frequency table if the object is "ordered".

    - print.CrossTable():
        - Removed the message "Total Observations in Table", since the number is
          printed in the table anyway.
        - Removed vertical bars from the output to give room for longer
          factor labels.
        - getOption("OutDec") now is used to format the numbers.
        - Expected frequency now is always printed with one decimal digit.

  New features:
