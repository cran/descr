Version 0.3.2 (2009-10-10)
--------------------------

  Bug fix:

    - Fixed documentation link to read.fwf().

    - Added domain = "R-descr" to all gettext().

    - Fixed conversion of fwf into csv when the fwf had \r\n line terminators
      and R was running on Linux. Also fixed reading of strings with spaces.

  Changes:

    - Inverted colors in the mosaic plot produced by crosstab().

    - Only add cumulative percent to frequency table if the object is "ordered".

    - print.CrossTable():
        - Removed the message "Total Observations in Table", since the number is
          printed in the table anyway.
        - Removed vertical bars from the output to give room for longer
          factor labels.
        - getOption("OutDec") now is used to format the numbers.
        - Expected frequency now is always printed with one decimal digit.

  New features:

    - Added function file.head(), which shows the first lines of a file (useful
      before read.table()).


Version 0.3.1 (2009-08-11)
--------------------------

  New features:

    - Included a version of CrossTable, adapted from gmodels package, with

Version 0.3.0 (2009-06-07)
--------------------------

  New features:

    - Added plot option to crosstab, compmeans and freq.

    - Renamed function crosstabs to crosstab.

    - LogRegR2 now accepts "probit" models.

  Bug fixes:

    - Fixed bug in the weighted standard deviation calculus in compmeans.
